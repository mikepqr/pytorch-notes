# Learning PyTorch

 - Start with [Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute
   Blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) (covers basic variable creation, largely agnostic about deep learning)
 - Then [Learning PyTorch with
   Examples](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/pytorch_with_examples.html)
   (covers training a deep learning network "by hand" and then using PyTorch's
   deep learning API)
 - Then [Grokking PyTorch](https://github.com/Kaixhin/grokking-pytorch), which
   is a walkthrough of the official MNIST example

This repository contains my notes on these three documents, and then an example
toy implementaton of linear regression (which you wouldn't actually solve with
PyTorch, but allowed me to confirm my understanding), and some noodling with
the Dataset/DataLoader API, which makes some of the fiddly minibatch/shuffling
bookkeeping associated with training much easier.
